### Repo with a few simple projects concerning numerical methods

1. lab1 - Gaussian Eliminiation Algorithm with Partial Pivoting for Band Matrixes
2. lab2 - Bilinear interpolation over a squared area using division into n^2 subsquares
3. lab3 - Integration of f(x,y) using the triangulation and 3rd rank quadrature 
4. lab4 - Least-squares approximation using Legendre polynomials in L^2(-1, 1) with p(x) = 1
5. lab5 - Finding all eigenvalues using the Power Method with L1 transform deflation
